    <h2>Slow &amp; Steady Wins The Race&nbsp;!</h2>
<p>
    Ok life can be a <em>rush</em>, agreed! I will not lie to you and tell you I have achieved what I have by taking
    it slow and chilling. Yet it is better to start things slow and improve gradually, so that we can keep a steady rhythm and
    do not lose our work-flow. Definitely, it is better to have a slower and constant flow, rather than rushing and having to
    leave the game half-way when things get more interesting. In the end we all want to cut the finish line, it is a matter
    of <em>consistency</em> and keeping your own pace in the long run.

    <h2>If You Want Something Done, Do It Yourself</h2>

Yes, if you want something done and you want it done properly, why should someone else do it better than you? Despite in some
cases cooperating and delegating are core parts of a successful <em>strategy</em>, I believe it is important to have at
least the ability/knowledge to do things on your own, so you know what the tasks require. In my most tough times I found
myself dealing directly with the issues, it was useless to ask others for help/advice at some points. I knew my way, and made
things work around it, fortunately!

    <h2>Every Cloud Has A Silver Lining <img class="svg" src="assets/images/cloud.svg" alt="cloud"></h2>
<p>
    Not all bad things come to hurt, exactly! even the worst things/events have a brighter side, it depends on the way we
    look at things, not the other way around. The world - or to be more precise its perception - can be a reflection
    of our own thoughts and emotions. And of course I am not saying that the world cannot be a mean and nasty place: life
    is too often not fair at all.. ok. But we are the creators of our own <em>destiny</em>, we can embrace life and shape our future!!

    <h2><strong>G-O-D</strong> Helps Those Who Help Themselves</h2>
<p>
    Ultimately, it is relevant to know on which tasks and life objectives to focus on. If we do not give ourselves the right <em>direction</em>
    nobody will: we can have <em>inspiration</em> from outside/above, but it starts with us to take the lead!

<p>
Yes, I know.. this is not a proper way of saying. It sounds more like the title of a nice movie! but is it just a movie?! or is there
a way of living? Many times we get caught in our own dilemmas and rules and we forget to <strong>LIVE L-I-F-E to the fullest</strong>: I want to end this page with
this conclusion ... I know speaking is easier.. but once we own the concept we just got to make it work! Life is good !! Life is beautiful ...
