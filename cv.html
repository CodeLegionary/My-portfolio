        'Vittorio Emanuele II' High School Degree in <em>Classic Studies</em>: mark of 85 out of 100. This school is deemed one of the best
        in Naples due to its historical heritage, and the peculiar subjects.
        I studied ancient Greek and Latin, and opted for the course that stressed <a href="#skills">English</a> as foreign language.
    </li>
    <li>
        'London Middlesex Univesity' Bachelor Degree (<em>BA Business Management with Spanish</em>): business studies with an extra course
        that was entirely in Spanish and focused on the entrepreneurial opportunities in Hispanic countries. I graduated
        after a three year course with a first class degree. I also broke a scoring record within an examination. In general I
        had the opportunity of mastering my language skills especially in an academic context&nbsp;(&#8595;&#8595;).

                SIA badge (door-supervisor): I got the training and skillset required to work as a security-guard. Overall it was

        <h2>&#10024;JOBS&#10024;</h2>

            <h3>LIFEGUARD</h3>
<p>
    Throughout my time in Italy and Spain I had time to take advantage of my certificate, covering the role of sea lifeguard.
    My most enriching job experience was in the balearic islands, where I had the opportunity of working for 'Marsave SRL', and
    assisted clients from all over the world. It was a great place to grow and develop <a href="#skills">Language Skills (go below)</a>.
</p>

            <h3>From Unskilled WORK To ADMIN ROLE&nbsp;&#128188;</h3>
<p>
    Alongside with my studies I managed to carry on some temporary jobs that fitted into my schedule. It was difficult and I
    take pride in saying that I had to start from humble roles. Berry Recruitment helped me with everything I needed, and
    eventually offered me to step-up as an administrator. Meanwhile I was still in the midst of my BA at London Middlesex University.
    It was a path of big achievements for me!
</p>

            <h3>SECURITY-GUARD</h3>
<p>Once I had got my SIA badge I was able to cover small roles among various high-profile locations. It was not easy due
    to the completion of my studies, but I can tell you it was possible and that hard-work is more satisfying!! Here are
    some pictures of that time in London (&#8595;&#8595;&#8595;).

        <h2 id="skills">&#10024;SKILLSETS&#10024;</h2>
            <h3>LANGUAGE SKILLS</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <img class="flag" src="images/England.svg" alt="England"> <strong>ENGLISH:</strong> Before enrolling in university I already accomplished an <em>IELTS academic score of 7.5</em>,
        which corresponds to a C1, and includes academic writing. From then on, I could just improve my language
        skills, and I had to test them in busy/stressful circumstances as well. Well done to me !!
        <br/>
        <img src="images/london1a.jpg" class="img-fluid" style="margin-left: -15px" alt="Me in London!">
        Though now I prefer to practice English through reading, listening and writing, since I do not currently live in the UK.
        When I have the occasion I am happy to have a conversation in spoken English. Certain things will never change!
    </li>
    <li>
        <img class="flag" src="images/Spain.svg" alt="Spain"> <strong>SPANISH:</strong> my Spanish is proficient and ready-to-use, yet I presently prefer to speak and think in English than in Spanish.
    </li>
</ul>


            <h3>COMPUTER SKILLS&nbsp;&#128187;</h3>
<p>
    I used predominantly Excel, Word, and Canvas/PowerPoint in presentations and reports for work and university. After that, I have
    developed years of experience in programming: I like both web development than OS/processor ones (i.e. C language, x86 assembly
    and motorola 68000). I learned all of these languages at my current university in Italy, where I study <em>Computer
    Engineering</em>. At some of these and other exams I distinguished myself with the highest score.
    I prefer programming rather than using the PC as an end-user that is unaware of the <em>Magic</em> behind these machines.
    Now my main interest is <em>web development</em>.
</p>

            <h3>HUMAN VERSATILITY</h3>
<p>
    I am a skilled individual that intends matching language skills with computer science. Can see myself starting as a web
    developer in order to gain experience and eventually upgrade my career in programming. I have good communication
    skills, and can be quite versatile. I am great at working in a team, either by taking directions
    or by taking the lead; I am built for challenges!
    Furthermore, I do have the great advantage of the English language, useful in official documentations, programming and <em>IA</em> assistance.
    I do not heavily rely on IA, but I understand the importance of tools such as Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT.
