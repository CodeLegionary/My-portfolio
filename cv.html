    <h1>CURRICULUM VITAE</h1>
        <h3>TITLES</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        'Vittorio Emanuele II' High School Degree in <em>Classic Studies</em>: mark of 85 out of 100. This school is deemed one of the best
        in Naples due to its historical heritage, and the subjects that characterize the 'forma mentis' of its students.
        I studied ancient Greek and Latin, and opted for the course that stressed the foreign language (i.e. English).
    </li>
    <li>
        'London Middlesex Univesity' Bachelor Degree (<em>BA Business Management with Spanish</em>): business studies with an extra course
        that was entirely in Spanish and focused on the entrepreneurial opportunities in Hispanic countries. I graduated
        after a three year course with a first class degree. I also broke a scoring record within an examination, and in general I
        got the opportunity of mastering my language skills, not only in an academic context such as university.
    </li>
    <li>Other Work-related Titles:
        <ol class="ndlist">
            <li>
                Lifeguard certificate: It allowed me to start to grow and have my first job experiences, and to practice English and
                Spanish at work later. This step was fundamental for me to begin my career!
            </li>
            <li>
                SIA badge (door-supervisor): I got the training and skillset required to work as a security-guard. It was a
                great forming experience and made me improve my English in a formal and work-friendly context. It was also fun.

        <h3>JOBS</h3>

            <h5>Lifeguard</h5>
<p>
    Throughout my time in Italy and Spain I had time to take advantage of my certificate, covering the role of sea lifeguard.
    My most enriching job experience was in the balearic islands, where I had the opportunity of working for 'Marsave SRL', and
    assisted clients from all over the world. It was a great place to grow and develop <a href="#skills">Language Skills (go below)</a>.
</p>

            <h5>from Unskilled Work to Admin Role</h5>
<p>
    Alongside with my studies I managed to carry on some temporary jobs that fitted into my schedule. It was difficult and I
    take pride in saying that I had to start from humble roles. Berry Recruitment helped me with everything I needed, and
    eventually proposed me to step-up as an administrator. Meanwhile I was still in the midst of my BA at London Middlesex University.
    It was a path of big achievements for me!
</p>

            <h5>Security</h5>
<p>Once I had got my SIA badge I was able to cover small roles among various high-profile locations. It was not easy due
    to the completion of my studies, but I can tell you it was possible and that hard-work pays off (when carried out in a smart way)!!

        <h3 id="skills">SKILLSETS</h3>
            <h5>Language Skills</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        <img class="flag" src="images/England.svg"> <i>ENGLISH</i>: Before enrolling in university I already accomplished an <em>IELTS academic score of 7.5</em>,
        which corresponds to a C1, and includes academic writing. From that moment onwards I could just improve my language
        skills, and I had to test them in busy/stressful circumstances as well. Well done to me !!
        <br/>
        Though now I prefer to practice English through reading, listening and writing, since I do not currently live in the UK.
        When I have the occasion I am happy to have a conversation in spoken English. Certain things will never fade away!
    </li>
    <li>
        <img class="flag" src="images/Spain.svg"> <i>SPANISH</i>: my Spanish is proficient and ready-to-use, yet I presently prefer to speak and think in English than in Spanish.
    </li>
</ul>

            <h5>Computer Skills</h5>
<p>
    I used predominantly microsoft Excel/Word at work, and PowerPoint/Word for university presentations and reports. After that, I have
    developed an experience of years in programming: I like both web development than OS/processor ones (i.e. C language, x86 assembly
    and motorola 68000). I learned all of these languages at my current university in Italy, where I study <em>Computer
    Engineering</em>. At some of these and other exams I distinguished myself with the highest score.
    I prefer much more programming rather than using the PC as an end-user that is unaware of the <em>Magic</em> behind these machines.
    Now my main interest is <em>web development</em>.
</p>

            <h5>Human Versatility</h5>
<p>
    I am a skilled individual that intends matching language skills with computer science. Can see myself starting as a web
    developer in order to gain new experience and eventually upgrade my career as usual. I have good communication
    skills, and can be quite versatile. I am great at working in a team, either by taking directions
    or by taking the lead; shying away from challenges is not for me!
    Furthermore, I already have had the luck to understand how knowing English is a great advantage, in
    terms of official documentations, programming and IA assistance. I do not heavily rely on IA, but I understand its importance.
