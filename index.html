        <hr/>

        <p>I tend to see myself as a cosmopolitan person. I was born in Naples, and I have travelled/lived in
        the continent for a little while. I am fluent in English and Spanish, and I am proud of my origins and achievements.
        I live in the present and look forward to the future best version of me!</p>
        <p>This <em>portfolio</em> is mainly intended to get you to know my persona, work ethic and thoughts; Hope you enjoy my
        sharing and find things that are good to know!
        </p>

        <p>The site is entirely realized by me and is developed as a sort of brief <em>report</em>, or blog articles if you want to see it that way!
        Reading time can vary from 8 to 12 minutes, as the total words amount to around 2000!</p>
    
        <p>If the site still results a little big, that's because my personality is not less either!!<br/> If you wanna go straight to the highlights check for the <em>flashing oasis</em>!

    <h3>Who am I? Self-made to the core</h3>
        <p>EVERYONE is !!!</p>
        <p>
        I believe people build themselves from within, external things do not fully belong to us. It's more like we administer everything.
        Under this perspective even entitlement/comfort - when it's too much - can become counterproductive!!
        Overall, I am a quite self-aware individual; I am glad of the opportunities life has given me - including the most challenging!
        </p>

    <h3>What I care for?</h3>
        <p>I have many interests. I like any type of language, without forgetting ancient greek and <em>programming</em> languages of course! I like philosophies like stoicism,
        and I enjoy reading kind of everything when I have some free time. For me <em>content writing</em> can be kind of an hobby too!<br/>
        I am a sports person, and once in a while I can also do some dancing! But I am more like a home/family-oriented individual overall.</p>
